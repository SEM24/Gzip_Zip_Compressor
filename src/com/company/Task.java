     * Implement the Strategy pattern for compressing the incoming OutputStream.
     * <p>
     * - The output should be a compressed OutputStream depending on the zip/gzip algorithm chosen
     * <p>
     * - Use lambda constructions
     * <p>
     * - How the data source is selected, the choice of the algorithm (interactive console, launch, config, ..) at your discretion
     * <p>
     * Note: for the zip algorithm, be sure to specify the file name in the archive:
     * <p>
     * ((ZipOutputStream) out).putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(..));
